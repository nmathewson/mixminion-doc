                            MIX3:ClientAPI
         Type III (Mixminion) Mix Client API Recommendations

Status of this Document

   This is a proposed C API for client functionality for Type III
   (Mixminion) mixes.  Right now, it's in a very rough state -- it
   needs to be audited for completeness fairly thoroughly.

   Also, for completeness, there should be companion Java/C++/C#/Perl/
   Python APIs as examples for how to wrap Type III mix clients in
   these OO languages.  I think I'll work on the Python one for
   Mixminion 0.0.6, and delay others till the C and Python APIs are
   nailed down.
